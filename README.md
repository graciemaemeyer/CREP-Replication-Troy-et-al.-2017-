# CREP-Replication-Troy-et-al.-2017-
This project was completed as part of a group project in a psychology seminar on open science at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. A replication of Troy et al. (2017) study 1 was conducted by Gracie Meyer, Taylor Knickel, and Dejana Seremet.
A direct replication and an additional extension hypothesis was explored. The focus of the extension hypothesis was on the measures of SES, as the original authors stated shortcomings of how SES was originally measured. Two new scales to measure social status (MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, Sense of Social Fit Scale) were added as well as questions surrounding parental education level, employment status, and social class in childhood. The target sample size is above 100 participants. Participants will be recruited from undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota through online advertising. The study will be completed fully online through a Qualtrics survey.
